<h3 align="center">I'm a Junior Data Analyst. I graduated in solciology, worked several years as a translator but eventually my love to identify (not only social) patterns brought me to Data Analysis. Right now I'm deepening my knowledge in BI and SQL and looking for interesting pet projects. I'm passionate about learning and developing new skills, which is the number one reason why I changed my field of activity to IT.  🇷🇺</h3>
